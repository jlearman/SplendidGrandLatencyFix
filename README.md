# SplendidGrandLatencyFix

Splendid Grand is a great piano but I noticed latency even though I'm not
particularly sensitive to it.  So, I processed the samples and removed the
silence or quiet noise at the beginning of each note sample.  (Only note
samples were changed.)

The sfz file provides a comparison keyswitch: 
  o Play C8 for original
  o Play Bb7 for trimmed (default)
  o Play A7 for trimmed right channel on left, original right channel on right

Note that your brain will comprehend a delay on one channel as spatial cue,
so you'll hear that rather than a slapback echo.

We plan to post the updated sample set on github.com/sfzinstruments.

Please let us know on KVR forum if there are any issues, and whether
you think we should replace the originals or provide both sample sets.
